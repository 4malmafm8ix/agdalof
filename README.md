This is a small library of logic, equational reasoning, and natural numbers written in Agda. I am interested in learning about "proofs-as-programs" and how this is implemented in a system like Agda. 

These files show how logic, both propositional and predicate, can be encoded in Agda. 

I wrote these while studying the following excellent resources: 
  - Programming Language Foundations in Agda, Wadler.
  - Lectures on Agda, Selinger.
